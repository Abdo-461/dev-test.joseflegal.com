# Josef Coding Challenge

The goal of this assignment is to get a sense for how you think and solve problems. If you're having build issues üîß with the project, please don't hesitate to contact us.

The challenge is to build upon a simple Vue.js application.

You may want to install [Vue Dev Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vuejs-devtools/nhdogjmejiglipccpnnnanhbledajbpd?hl=en) to enrich your Vue dev experience.

## Instructions

In `src/views/Dashboard.vue` you'll find a component that is loading data from an API.

1. Render the list of files from the API.

2. Create a reusable component to render the items, using a combination of [props](https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#props) and [slots](https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#v-slot).

3. The design / UI is open for you to decide üòÅ. Try to use some of the scss variables in `src/styles/resources/_variables.scss` to give it a Josef feel.

4. Create a [computed property](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/computed.html) that takes the files data and filters it for tags that include `kitten` then sorts it by date.

## Extra Credit

1. The files data is currently being managed locally in `src/views/Dashboard.vue`, migrate it to a [vuex module](https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/modules.html) in `src/store`. *See example in `src/store/user`.*
2. Write some unit tests for your challenge in `/tests/unit`.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Application runs on: http://localhost:9001
