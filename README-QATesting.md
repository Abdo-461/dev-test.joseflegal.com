The test compromises on automatically filling up the form and submitting it. I have added a message that will display when form is submitted successfully to allow for testing to detect the success of the test.

For best testing results :-

navigate to the root directory of the project and run the following the command

 npx cypress run

 The terminal will show the tests running and display the results of the tests. Cypress will also create a video showing the process of the test running and display the results of the test. 

 Test video will be available under tests/e2e/videos
