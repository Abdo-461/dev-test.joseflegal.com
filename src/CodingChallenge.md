## Josef Coding Challenge

This dev task is in a simple Vue JS SPA.
Install [Vue Dev Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vuejs-devtools/nhdogjmejiglipccpnnnanhbledajbpd?hl=en) so you can easily inspect components.

### UI

In `Dashbaord.vue` you'll find some files data that is being loaded from an API.
Create a reusable component to render this data and use it in `Dashboard.vue`.
Use a combination of [props](https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#props) and [slots](https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#v-slot)
You can do this as a list or card - up to you! üòÅ Feel free to take inspiration from open source UI libraries available but try to use some the Josef variables in `_variables.scss` to give it a Josef feel.
